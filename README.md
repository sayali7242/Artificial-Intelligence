# Artificial-Intelligence
This repository contains the python code to maximize Pacmanâ€™s expected utility using modern methods in Artificial Intelligence. Here, I implemented an autonomous Pacman agent and ghost agents using an array of AI techniques, such as informed state-space search methods (BFS, DFS, A*, Adversarial and Stochastic), probabilistic inference, reinforcement learning, and machine vision in
order to draw inferences in uncertain environments and optimize actions for arbitrary reward structures.
